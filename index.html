                Our Cooperation had 2 phase. Phase 1: 6 months Freelancer - We
                worked on In-Panel Pages and Funnels. Phase 2: 5 months
                Full-Time - Redesign Admin Panel ,some landing pages and add new

                Limoo is a team communication platform. First I was resposible
                to make job interview and qulifie the resomes. After about one
                month we hired a Product designer. The I worked 30h per month as
                a UI/UX Consultant. Our First challenge was “How and from Where
                we should start”. Finally we decided to Change a few basic
                things that can make better experience and then developed a
                section per section redesign and develop in several phases.
                There we’ve build a good connection between designers and
                developers.

                Dadsun is a legal platform that helps users to find a suitable
                lawyer. Dadsun had 4 dimensions: Users, Lawyers, Marketers &
                Admin. Therefore as a designer, we (Hossein Malekalaei and me)
                had to connect these 4 dimensions smoothly. When I joined there,
                It was about a year passed than The last release. So there were
                enough data to understand where’s the problem. We used BI &
                analyse tools to make it clear. Then we made a redesign to “make
                funnels better with low user costs and delete some useless
                parts”, “apply aesthetic usability effect”, “add some more
                colors to our design system,” “fix usability issues in our
                layout and some UI components,” “make Dadsun services more
                accessible and smother” and “design a better information
                architecture and layout design especially in lawyers listing
                page and lawyers detail pages.” In Dadsun, we worked in scrum
                methodology.
